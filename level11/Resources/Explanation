scp -P 4242 level00@127.0.0.1:getflag ./
using cutter to check c code of binary
analyze binary strings
strings getflag
gives 15 lines of strings that might be tokens (they are not but almost)
tried getuid change function return, didn't work
'You should not reverse this'
look at program structure
ptrace, getuid checks
ptrace anti-debugging shield, can be changed via gdb, return needed value
try again getuid function values
it returns 2000 which corresponds with value of uid in /etc/passwd file for current level
change the value to the flag's uid - get token for any level
repeat for every level.
